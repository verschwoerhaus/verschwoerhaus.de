Welcome to the Verschwörhaus – the “Experimentation platform for the world of tomorrow”! We have 3D Printers, an Open Workshop Area, Lecture rooms – and, most importantly, a lot of ideas and content to accompany our home city of Ulm into the future!

The Verschwörhaus is located in a former Sparkasse building between Ulm's synagogue and the historic "Schwörhaus" on Weinhof.


## What are the opening hours?
You will find the guaranteed opening hours on our [calendar](/en/termine-und-oeffnungszeiten). Usually, all events listed there come with an accompanying text which goes in more detail and offers a signup link, if necessary.

For last-minute-announcements about unforeseen events, make sure to follow us on Twitter or just drop by when the traffic signal in the front window glows green!


## Active groups and regular events
The Verschwörhaus can only exist because many volunteers fill it with life, in various ways. Here's a quick overview about all the different groups and recurring events:
